            <p> For the past year I have worked has a Campus Representative for Bigelow Tea. I worked with another student and 3 members of the Bigelow Tea and Faiefield faculty to host on campus promotional events to create brand awarenss among the college student demogrpahic. I also managed the @fairfield_universitea Instagram account where I posted engaging graphic designs about health and wellness benefits of tea, or I pushed the fact that Bigelow Tea is women founded and run, the sustainability efforts of the company etc. I utilized Canva to make these posts and advertise for the on campus events. I grew the following from about 9 followers to 260 followers and will continue to grow that number this semester. I also worked as a store associate and cashier for Burlington in my town. I gained excellent communication and service skills through facilitating positive experiences for customers. I quickly completed transactions, returns and adapted to any necessary changes or requests. </p>
